# Bank Beta Project
Bank Beta customers are leaving the company little by little, their number decreasing every month. Bank employees realized that it would be more cost-effective if the company focused on retaining their old, loyal customers rather than attracting new customers. In this case, the main task is to predict whether a customer will soon leave the bank or not. 

## Objective 
The data available is data related to clients' past behavior and the history of terminating their contracts with the bank. From this data, develop a model with the maximum possible F1 score. To be declared to have passed the review. The minimum F1 score in this case is 0.59 for the test dataset. Additionally, measure the AUC-ROC metric and compare it to the F1 score.
